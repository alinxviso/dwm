# dwm

these are my dwm configs, if you want to see them, switch branches to the version you want

old readme can be found at README

so far my main is 6.2, and will probably have the most patches

default branch is 6.2

current branch is 6.2

## patches

all patches applied, in order, can be found in the patches/applied.txt file

all patches will use the base -6.2.diff version if available

patches that aren't added for special reasons but still function can found in patches/special

patches that are neat but i don't really want are in patches/optional
